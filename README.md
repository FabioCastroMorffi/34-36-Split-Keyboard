# Magnetic Split
## Overview

Magnetic Split is a 32 key wired split keyboard that has a small tweak, it has magnets that allow for the "halves" to join with a male/female (poorly executed) mechanism. I decided to go for a smaller keyboard for two main reasons: I want to use it mainly to type, so many keys weren't necessary, and I wanted to be under the 50$ mark.


## Motivation
After finishing my design for Hackpad, which was an introduction to PCB Design and 3D modelling, I was confident I could go build a bigger project in a more efficient manner but I was completely wrong. I got sent to the Valley of Stupidity earlier than expected. 

Even though the obstacles were many, mainly on the 3D modelling (omg its hard), it was a great learning experience and it will help me build better projects in the future. 

## PCB
(Initially I wanted to have two PCBS for left and Right, but it ended up being too expensive so I will use only the right one (front and back) for the build)

## CAD
Due to Fusion360 not being able, in any possible way and trust me I tried **many** alternatives, in Linux, I had to change to OnShape. And It was Great. OnShape provides a great experience that, to me, felt much more intuitive than Fusion.
