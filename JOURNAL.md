## June 6th 2025 - Initial idea

I've wanted to build a split keyboard for some time but with an additional twist, something unique to it. After brainstorming a for a little while, I found I wanted an original design that had something to do with magnets (magnets are so cool!). Watching projects such as this [one](https://keychron.com.au/blogs/archived/why-is-the-split-keyboard-good-for-you), I thought about a split keyboard that could become a single one with magnets and perhaps trigger something on OLED screens with the use of Hall Effect Sensors(not sure at all about this but we'll see as we progress).

Most of the time today was me thinking about an interesting idea, but I also started doing the schematics of the pcb. I'm thinking of going for a wired build using RP Pico 2040 as the microcontrollers and using TRRS Jack for the communitcation between the two sides.
